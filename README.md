ABSTRACT 

Quantum computing, with its potential to revolutionize computational capabilities, offers new 
avenues for tackling complex problems in finance. This paper investigates the application of 
Grover's algorithm, a fundamental quantum algorithm for unstructured search, in the context of 
stock market analysis. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for efficiently searching 
unstructured stock ticker data using Grover's algorithm. By leveraging quantum parallelism and 
amplitude amplification, our approach aims to significantly reduce the computational resources 
required for identifying relevant stock tickers within large datasets. We provide a theoretical 
framework for the implementation of Grover's algorithm in this domain and discuss potential 
challenges and opportunities. Furthermore, we present simulation results to demonstrate the 
effectiveness and scalability of our approach in comparison to classical search algorithms. Our 
findings suggest that Grover's algorithm holds promise for enhancing stock market analysis by 
enabling rapid and efficient retrieval of relevant stock ticker information, thereby facilitating 
more informed investment decisions. This research contributes to the ongoing exploration of 
quantum computing applications in finance and lays the groundwork for future advancements in 
this field.
